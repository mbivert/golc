Okay so far:
  - Untyped λ-calculus evaluation;
  - Mathematical expressions extensions;
  - Interactions between the two previous points;
  - Simple typing, assuming everything is correctly annotated

TODO:
  - Import evaluation tests
  - Benchmark; if relevant, look to implement de Bruijn indexes
  - Entry point (e.g. a REPL)
  - Manage other quantum extensions
  - Eventually look for implementing differential λ-calculus features?

  - naming conventions are irregular (e.g. parse vs. evalExpr)
